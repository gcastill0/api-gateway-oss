CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature implemented by web browsers to restrict web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page. This is done to prevent malicious websites from accessing sensitive data on other domains without permission.

When a CORS error occurs, the browser typically blocks the request and provides an error message in the browser console. Unfortunately, due to security reasons, the `fetch` API does not expose detailed error messages about CORS issues to the JavaScript code. Instead, it simply throws a generic `TypeError` with a message like `Failed to fetch`.

### Additional Notes:

- **CORS Errors in the Browser Console**: CORS errors will still appear in the browser console with detailed information. Users can check the console for more specific error messages.
- **CORS Configuration**: To resolve CORS issues, ensure that the server you are making requests to includes the appropriate CORS headers in its responses. For example:

  ```http
  Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
  Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS
  Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization
  ```
